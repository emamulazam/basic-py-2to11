# Importing All Functions in a Module
# You can tell Python to import every function in a module by using the asterisk (*) operator:

from pizza_01 import *
# from module_name import *
make_pizza(16, "pepperoni")
make_pizza(12, 'mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese')


''' every function is imported, you can call each function by name without using the dot
notation '''
